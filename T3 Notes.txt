I have the baseline code worked out for gathering the data together based 
on the same names and then spreading it out and making the data wide.
I'm having issues now with the data when spread the variables default to 0s and 1s.
I'm currently trying to fix this issue and then I'll be able to combine and get rid of certain columns to better fit like our data.
